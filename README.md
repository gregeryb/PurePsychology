# PurePsychology
A Java GUI implementation of the game Pure Psychology/Game of Pure Skill

The game is described here: http://www.nomic.net/deadgames/acka/devjoe/gnc/G102.html although that is the 3 player version.  What's implemented here is the 2 player version

Each round is 13 turns where you and a Computer opponent simultaneously bid using the values $1 to $13. The higher bid wins the round and gets the points that were up for sale.
